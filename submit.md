Review Process
---------------------

* Articles are reviewed on monthly cycles, starting on the first of each month. Deadlines are the first of each month.

* If an article is accepted without changes, the article will be published immediately in that month's issue.

* If an article is not accepted, the authors may choose to submit it the following month.

* Papers of four or fewer pages long will be reviewed in one month's time. That is, any article submitted by the first of the month will be returned with reviews and a decision by the end of the month. Eight or fewer pages, two month's time. Twelve, three month's. And so on.

* Articles are reviewed in a single-blind fashion.

* The editorial board is divided in half, such that half of the editors handle submissions on odd months, and half on even months.

Special Issues
--------------------

* Potential guest editors may submit proposals for special issues. The reviewing process remains the same, except that the guest editors do the work that the editorial board would normally do.

* Proposals for special issues are reviewed by the editors in chief, and will be evaluated according to their relevance to the journal and their likelihood to attract high quality submissions.

* The editors in chief will aggressively solicit *best papers* from top conferences to submit to special issues.

* Workshops and conferences are simply treated as special issues. Here is an example of how a hypothetical paper that is presented at a conference that is published as a special issue would be cited:

    @article{citeulike:11236861,
    author = {Rodriguez, Bender},
    doi = {10.1007/s10844-006-9928-6},
    issn = {0925-9992},
    journal = {Proceedings of the Conference on Advanced Bending Technologies in the Journal of Software Science},
    volume = {9},
    number = {3},
    pages = {7--24},
    title = {Bite Me},
    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1419.0569},
    year = {2014}
}

- Some notion of "categories" for papers (?)
- The "volume" of a journal is not the year as is traditional, instead
a new volume is released whenever the editorial policy changes.
- 1st issue: perspetives on open science and software engineering.
(this is a consistent "category")
- Regular virtual town hall.
- PDF in some prescribed format.
- Review time is proportional to paper length. (4 pages per month)
- Camera ready papers on openscience.us
- CC license: Attribution 4.0.
- Preferences given to those who make their artifacts available.
