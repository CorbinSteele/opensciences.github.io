## History

This is version four of the Promise repository:

+ _Version 0_: Initially, in 2002, NASA ran the Metrics Data Program (MDP)
  for static code measures collected from NASA projects.
+ _Version 1_: In 2004, samples from MDP became the PROMISE _v1.0_ repository hosted
  at _ottawa.ca_
+ _Version 2_: That site grew and in 2006 was moved to a web-site supported
  by a home-brew
  macro system at _promisedata.org_.
+ _Version 3_: In 2008, after numerous security hacks,
   that site was moved a more maintainable site at
  _promisedata.googlecode.com_. This third version was
  restricted in size to under 10GBs.
+ _Version 4:_ In 2014, with support from NcState,
  that site was upgraded to  terabyte size.  At
  the same time, a support discussion forum was created at
  _openscience.us/content_.
