### History

This is version four of the Promise repository:

+ _Version 0_: Initially, in 2002, NASA ran the Metrics Data Program (MDP)
  for static code measures collected from NASA projects.
+ _Version 1_: In 2004, samples from MDP became the PROMISE _v1.0_ repository hosted
  at _ottawa.ca_.
Founded by Tim Menzies and Jelber Sayyad, this repo was one of the first widely-used repositories of software engineering project data (mostly, static code attributes linked to defect and effort information). A key feature of the repository was that it was linked to an annual conference. Activity and contributions to the repository became linked to paper publication (both at the conference and at the seven journal special issues where the authors of best conference papers were invited to submit extended versions of their conference papers).
+ _Version 2_: That site grew and in 2006 was moved to a web-site supported
  by a home-brew
  macro system at _promisedata.org_.
+ _Version 3_: In 2008, after numerous security hacks,
   that site was moved a more maintainable site at
  _promisedata.googlecode.com_. This third version was
  restricted in size to under 10GBs.
  Submissions to this repository and associated PROMISE conference grew to 2010. The PROMISE
  conference received (10,16,34,53) submissions in (2007,2008,2009,2010) which was an annual growth of (160,212,156). As of 2010, the repository was in widespread use. In that year, Tim Menzies spent two hours on IEEE Explorer and found 73 papers that used the repository . 
+ _Version 4:_ In 2014, with support from NcState,
  that site was upgraded to  terabyte size.  At
  the same time, a support discussion forum was created at
  [http://openscience.us/ssj](http://openscience.us/ssj).
