# About the Data

## Overview of Data

We ran our prototype on 47 methods of 7 classes taken from the Stack Java Standard Library and the Graphstream library. We automatically synthesized 123 equivalent method sequences, which represent more than 87% of the 141 sequences that we manually identified ahead by inspecting the classes documentation.

# Paper abstract

This paper proposes a search-based technique to synthesize
sequences of method invocations that are equivalent to a
target method within a finite set of execution scenarios.
The experimental results obtained on 47 methods from 7
classes show that the proposed approach correctly identifies
equivalent method sequences in the majority of the cases
where redundancy was known to exist, with very few false
positives.
