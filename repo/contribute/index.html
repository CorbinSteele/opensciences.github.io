<p>There are two ways to contribute to the OpenSciences project.</p>

<h1>Email us your data</h1>

If you own or have access to data that you (and the author(s), if you are not an author) would like easily accessible through OpenScience.us, email Carter Pape at [crpape@ncsu.edu](mailto:crpape@ncsu.edu) and Mitch Rees-Jones at [mwreesjo@ncsu.edu](mailto:mwreesjo@ncsu.edu). Give us a link to your data, and a description that provides some context about it.

<h1>2. Join our hackathons</h1>
<p>We will be periodically hosting hackathons to track down and add SE data and papers en masse. If you are interested in joining one, either remotely using Google Hangouts or in person in Engineering Building II on North Carolina State's campus, email Carter Pape at [crpape@ncsu.edu](mailto:crpape@ncsu.edu) and Mitch Rees-Jones at [mwreesjo@ncsu.edu](mailto:mwreesjo@ncsu.edu).{{ site.hackathonInfo }}</p>
