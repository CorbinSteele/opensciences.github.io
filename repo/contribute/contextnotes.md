Datasets added to the PROMISE repository must have context notes so that people accessing the datasets in the repository know what it's about. As we centralize research data, it is important to also centralize the knowledge associated with that data in the form of context notes outlined here.

If you are a researcher emailing us your data, please include the following sections of
information about your data/research in the email. If you are participating in a hackathon, please comment on the GitHub issue associated with the data, including the following sections of information in your comment.

#### 1. Paper title

#### 2. Link to the paper associated with the dataset
 * This should be either a link to the ACM digital library (for example, [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2635868.2635905](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2635868.2635905), IEEE digital library (for example, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6982619](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6982619), or some other standard library.

#### 3. Author list for the paper (including emails)

#### 4. BibTeX reference for the paper

#### 5. Link to the datasets
 * If multiple files come with it, include links to all files, not just the parent file
  * Red flags should go up if, after downloading all the data, it is larger than 100 MB (compressed).

#### 6. PROMISE repo category (effort, requirements, model, defect, etc.)
 * Categorize the data into one of the categories in the navbar on the [OpenScience website](/repo).
   If it doesn't fit nicely into one of these categories, put "other" and propose a category name.

#### 7. General overview of the data
 * Note that this is not the abstract of the paper. If you can find an overview of the dataset in the author's own words, just copy those words. If not, make your own overview. Paragraph long (if you are making it yourself)

#### 8. Paper abstract

#### 9. Is this dataset part of a larger series or collection?
 * If so, link to the master index of the series or collection (if possible)
