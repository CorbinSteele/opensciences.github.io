There are two ways to contribute to the OpenSciences project.

# 1. Email us your data

If you own or have access to data that you (and the author(s), if you are not an author) would like to be easily accessible through the Open Science repository, email Carter Pape at [crpape@ncsu.edu](mailto:crpape@ncsu.edu) or Mitch Rees-Jones at [mwreesjo@ncsu.edu](mailto:mwreesjo@ncsu.edu). Give us a link to your data, and a description that provides some context about it.

# 2. Join our hackathons

We will be periodically hosting hackathons to track down and add SE data and papers en masse. If you are interested in joining one, either remotely using Google Hangouts or in person in Engineering Building II on the campus of North Carolina State University, email Carter Pape at [crpape@ncsu.edu](mailto:crpape@ncsu.edu) or Mitch Rees-Jones at [mwreesjo@ncsu.edu](mailto:mwreesjo@ncsu.edu).
