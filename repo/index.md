This repository is an update to the older PROMISE repository of SE data.

Our goal is to be a long term storage facility for SE data. Many researchers take the time to carefully host their data on their own web sites. But as people move through their career, those web sites can fade away and take away their data. Hopefully, using this repo, we can make 
conclusions in SE repeatable, and repeatable for a  longer time.

This site has size restrctions (1TB, total) and we are chasing funds to change that (coming soon: peta-Promise?). That said, we are making progress. For example, this site can hold 500 times the data of the last version. 

For more details on what we have in the repo, please browse the left-hand side site map. Note that these categories are not
fixed- the more data you contribute, the more our categories change.

### How to Contribute 

To make such  contribution, please send a message to
[openscience.content@gmail.com](mailto:openscience.content@gmail.com) 
describing what you have and how much disk space it takes (ideally, we  take all data but there are some pragmatic restrictions).
Also, the [contribute page](/repo/contribute) has a wealth of information on how to contribute.
