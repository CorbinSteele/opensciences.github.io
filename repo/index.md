This repository is an update to the older PROMISE repository of SE data.

Our goal is to be a _one-stop shop_ for researchers looking for SE-related data. Hopefully, using this repo, we can make 
conclusions in SE repeatable, refutable and even improvable.


For more details on what we have in the repo, please browse the right-hand side site map. Note that these categories are not
fixed- the more data you contribute, the more our categories change.

### How to Contribute 

To make such  contribution, please send a message
[opensciences.content@gmail.com](emailto:opensciences.content@gmail.com) 
describing what you have and how much disk space it takes (ideally, we  take all data but there are some pragmatic restrictions).
