##Abstract

Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) is fundamental
to the development and optimization of software
systems. We propose five novel parallel algorithms for solving
MOCO problems exactly and efficiently. Our algorithms
rely on off-the-shelf solvers to search for exact Pareto-optimal
solutions, and they parallelize the search via collaborative
communication, divide-and-conquer, or both. We demonstrate
the feasibility and performance of our algorithms by
experiments on three case studies of software-system designs.
A key finding is that one algorithm, which we call
FS-GIA, achieves substantial (even super-linear) speedups
that scale well up to 64 cores. Furthermore, we analyze
the performance bottlenecks and opportunities of our parallel
algorithms, which facilitates further research on exact,
parallel MOCO.
