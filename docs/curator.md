# Curator
The Curator is responsible for adding datasets to tera-PROMISE as they are discovered. The datasets are discovered 
by data finders at "hackathons" (see the [contribute pages](/repo/contribute)) and each dataset is brought into the
workflow as a GitHub issue. The Curator then takes the GitHub issue and all of its corresponding information and
puts it in the repository, by taking context notes (a short description with metadata about the datasets, written
by data finders) and creating a description page ([example](/repo/other/dmtech.html)) on the GitHub site and then
uploading the data to an SVN repository.

# A general workflow of the Curator
 1. Find a GitHub issue for a paper/dataset to add
 2. Take the context notes from the issue and put it into a template description page ([example](/repo/other/dmtech.html))
 3. Put the newly created description page in the correct category within the GitHub site
 4. Download the data from the link found in the issue and upload it to the SVN repository
 5. Email the authors of the dataset/associated paper
 6. Close the GitHub issue
