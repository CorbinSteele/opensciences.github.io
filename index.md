Welcome to the documentation for the OpenScience job roles. This page is indended for people interested in becoming 
a curator or web developer for OpenScience, specifically the tera-PROMISE repository. I'll first be going over some 
background information about what OpenScience does and what the tera-PROMISE repository does, and then I'll go over 
what specific work that a Curator and a Web Developer does for the repository.

# Background
OpenScience is a collection of three major projects: the tera-PROMISE repository, the Software Science Journal 
(SSJ), and the "Latest Developments in Software Engineering" book. As of Spring 2015, only the tera-PROMISE 
repository has been fully implemented; however, plans still exist for development of the journal and the book. You 
can see the three projects in the homepage at [openscience.us](http://openscience.us).

The tera-PROMISE repository is fundamentally a repository for data. More specifically, it stores software 
engineering (SE) research data in the long term (more details in the next section about why it exists). The SSJ is 
an academic journal that writes about the more useful data from the repository, and the book is a more substantial  
academic text that condenses the best parts of the journal as they are generated over the journal's maturation. You 
may have noticed the blurbs underneath the project icons on the homepage: "Pieces and bits from SE research", 
"Judging which bits are useful", and "A textbook on the useful bits"; they describe the workflow of "repository to 
journal to book" pretty well.
